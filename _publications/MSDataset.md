## Abstract
Visible images have been widely used for indoor motion estimation. Thermal images, in contrast, are more challenging to be used in motion estimation since they typically have lower resolution, less texture, and more noise. In this paper, a novel dataset for evaluating the performance of multi-spectral motion estimation systems is presented. The dataset includes both multi-spectral and dense depth images with accurate ground-truth camera poses provided by a motion capture system. All the sequences are recorded from a handheld multi-spectral device, which consists of a standard visible-light camera, a long-wave infrared camera, and a depth camera. The multi-spectral images, including both color and thermal images in full sensor resolution (640 [Math Processing Error] 480), are obtained from the hardware-synchronized standard and long-wave infrared camera at 32Hz. The depth images are captured by a Microsoft Kinect2 and can have benefits for learning cross-modalities stereo matching. In addition to the sequences with bright illumination, the dataset also contains scenes with dim or varying illumination. The full dataset, including both raw data and calibration data with detailed specifications of data format, is publicly available.
