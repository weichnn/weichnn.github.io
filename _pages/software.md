## Dataset

------

* [Multi-Spectral Dataset](https://github.com/NGCLAB/multi-spectral-dataset)
The multi-spectral dataset is provided for evaluating multi-spectral motion estimation methods. The dataset includes sequences in diverse illumination conditions obtained on a setup consisting of a standard camera, an LWIR camera, and a Kinect2. These sensors provide color, thermal, and depth images and the ground-truth trajectory in the dataset.

    Related Software:

    * [Utilities for Multi-spectral Dataset](https://github.com/weichnn/bag_extractor)
    This is meant as simple, minimal example of how to extract data from multi-spectal dataset bags and how to generate dense depth images in the standard camera's view.

    * [Evaluation Tools](https://github.com/weichnn/Evaluation_Tools)
    This repository provides usually used trajectory evaluation methods for visual-based navigation systems.


<!-- ## Software

------

* [LiDAR Intensity Completion](https://github.com/NGCLAB/Lidar_intensity_completion)
We propose exploiting the information from both intensity and depth measurements to complete the LiDAR intensity and depth maps simultaneously. With the completed intensity maps, mature computer vision techniques without any specific adjustment can work well on the LiDAR data.
